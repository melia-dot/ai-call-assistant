# AI Call Assistant - Build Roadmap

## Project Status: Functional MVP with Real-time Dashboard

### Current State (September 2025)
- **Base System**: Fully deployed and operational
- **Phone Number**: +44 7427 134999 (verified, active)
- **Deployment**: Live at https://ai-call-assistant-henna.vercel.app
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL initialized with call logging tables
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Modern glassmorphism UI with live status updates

### Working Components

#### Core Call Processing ✅
- Twilio webhook endpoints receiving and processing calls
- UK compliance: Call recording notifications implemented
- Speech-to-text (STT) via Twilio's built-in service
- Text-to-speech (TTS) responses with natural flow

#### AI Analysis ✅
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration for intent classification
- Intent categories: emma_request, sales_general, business_general, nonsense, unclear
- Fallback mock analysis for cost control during development
- JSON response parsing with error handling

#### Call Routing ✅
- Emma-first routing logic when specifically requested
- Michael call screening with AI-generated summaries
- Sales callback booking flow with calendar integration points
- Automatic filtering of prank/nonsense calls

#### Data Management ✅
- Neon PostgreSQL database with proper schema
- Call logging with timestamps, intents, outcomes, transcripts
- Real-time dashboard queries and statistics
- Environment variable configuration

#### Dashboard ✅
- Modern responsive UI with gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism
- Real-time status banner showing call progression
- Live statistics: calls today, successful routes, sales inquiries, filtered calls
- Call history log with intent classification display
- Server-Sent Events for real-time updates

### Known Issues Requiring Resolution

#### Build System ⚠️
- Latest deployment showing truncated logs, possible build completion issues
- Need to verify full deployment success before production testing
- Real-time SSE broadcasting may need validation

#### Call Testing 🔄
- System ready for end-to-end testing with verified caller IDs
- Need validation of complete call flow: greeting → speech analysis → routing
- Dashboard real-time updates pending live call validation

#### Integration Gaps 🚧
- Google Calendar API integration planned but not implemented
- HubSpot CRM integration scaffolded but needs API configuration
- SMS notifications framework ready, needs Twilio SMS setup

### Architecture Philosophy

#### Enterprise-Grade Structure

#### Design Principles
- **Small Files**: Each component <100 lines, single responsibility
- **Clear Separation**: API routes only handle HTTP, orchestrators manage flow
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation at each layer
- **Stateless Design**: Event-driven webhooks, no session dependencies

### Technology Stack

#### Core Infrastructure
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and App Router
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier, serverless functions)
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (free tier, 3GB storage)
- **Source Control**: GitHub with automated Vercel deployments

#### External Services
- **Telephony**: Twilio Voice API (trial account, £11 credit)
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (existing API key reused)
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphism design
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events for dashboard updates

#### Development Environment
- **Hardware**: 2017 MacBook (compatible, tested)
- **Terminal**: All commands provided without comments for efficiency
- **Deployment**: Git → GitHub → Vercel automated pipeline

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Verify Latest Deployment**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://ai-call-assistant-henna.vercel.app/api/01-voice -d "CallSid=test&From=+447311197634&To=+447427134999"
   ```

2. **Test End-to-End Call Flow**
   - Call +44 7427 134999 from verified number
   - Verify dashboard real-time updates
   - Confirm database logging

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Complete Google Calendar integration
   - Configure HubSpot CRM API
   - Implement SMS notifications
   - Add authentication to dashboard

### Future Enhancements

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Voice authentication for sensitive routing
- Multi-language support for international callers
- Advanced analytics and call pattern recognition
- Integration with CRM workflows

#### Phase 3: Scale Preparation
- Redis for session management in high-volume scenarios
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Load balancing for multiple Twilio numbers

### Cost Management
- **Current**: Operating within free tiers across all services
- **Scaling**: Claude API usage minimal due to mock fallbacks
- **Production**: Estimated £10-20/month for moderate call volume

### Demo Readiness
The system demonstrates enterprise software development principles with a complete call assistant capable of:
- Professional call handling with AI-powered routing
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Proper separation of concerns and type safety
- Production-ready architecture patterns

**Status**: Ready for interview demonstrations and production pilot testing.
